# PyBTreeMap

A python wrapper around Rust's BTreeMap. Work in progress

## Building

todo

## Implementation Details

## Why?

good question

## Performance

When its usable I'll do some benchmarking

## Plan

[ ] fix the iterators, they dont work
[ ] implement other types (at least floats, strings, and bytes) with macros
[ ] implement a unified python interface that hides some details
[ ] get the final interators working
