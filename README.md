# PyBTreeMap

A python wrapper around Rust's BTreeMap. Work in progress

## Building & Development

In a virtual environment with maturin available, run `matrin develop` to build and install in the local environment, or `maturin develop --extras=devel` to build with development dependencies, such as pytest.

## Implementation Details

## Why?

good question

## Performance

When its usable I'll do some benchmarking

## Plan

- [ ] implement other types (at least floats, strings, and bytes) with macros
- [ ] implement a generic version
- [ ] implement a unified python interface that hides some details
- [ ] make some benchmarks
- [ ] package
